You are designing puzzle ideas for a narrative-driven game with the theme **“Chain Reaction.”**

### Core Concept
- The game focuses on **cause-and-effect** gameplay, where each action triggers the next in a carefully sequenced chain of events.  
- Players must solve a variety of **logic** and **physics-based** challenges by figuring out the correct order of actions that will set off a chain reaction.
- The player controls an **MC** (main character) who has entered a mysterious, ruined Mayan-inspired ancient portal in search of a powerful artifact that can reshape their fate.
- Early in the story, the MC meets a **mysterious girl** who guides them through the trials and puzzles of the temple. She provides them with:
  1. **Ancient Device**: A tool that interacts with mechanisms, allowing the player to rewind, queue, or link triggers in the environment. It can activate certain hidden or dormant systems and connect unrelated events in sequence.
  2. **Elemental Bow**: A bow that shoots elemental arrows (Fire, Water, Earth, Air). These arrows can trigger various effects on the environment, such as burning obstacles, freezing water, triggering winds, or moving earth-based objects. 

### Setting
- **Levels 1–5:** These levels are set outside the temple ruins and serve as the **teaching phase**, where the player learns the basic mechanics and begins to understand the theme of cause-and-effect chain reactions. Locations include mystical ancient courtyards, overgrown ruins, and ritual sites with elemental statues and environmental puzzles.
- **Levels 6–10:** These levels take place inside the temple, where the puzzles grow significantly more complex. The architecture becomes more intricate, with Mayan-inspired murals, rotating gears, mirrors, elemental statues, and more sophisticated puzzle mechanics. These levels serve as the **mastery phase**, where players are expected to integrate multiple mechanics learned from the earlier levels.

### Puzzle Requirements
Each puzzle should:
1. Use **cause-and-effect chain reactions**, meaning one action should trigger another in a sequence, requiring the player to think critically about the order in which they perform actions.
2. Incorporate **elemental interactions** (Fire, Water, Earth, Air), with each element playing a role in manipulating the environment. For example, a fire arrow could burn a vine, but a water arrow could extinguish it.
3. Require **sequential logic**, meaning that the order in which the player performs actions matters. There might be multiple ways to interact with a puzzle, but only one correct sequence will lead to a solution.
4. Include **interactive environmental elements**, such as mirrors, cranks, levers, movable blocks, ropes, gears, and other interactive objects, beyond simply shooting arrows.
5. Gradually **increase in complexity** across the levels, starting with simple puzzles and progressing to more intricate challenges that require creative thinking, timing, and strategic use of both the bow and the ancient device.

### Examples of Puzzle Styles
- **Light puzzles** (like in Assassin’s Creed): Rotate mirrors or prisms to redirect beams of light or energy.
- **Physics puzzles**: Use the environment to manipulate heavy objects, like rolling boulders or floating logs, or to build bridges with swinging elements.
- **Timing puzzles**: Activate certain elements (e.g., windmills, platforms) in a specific rhythm to advance, requiring precision timing.
- **Balance puzzles**: Maintain a delicate equilibrium between elements, such as balancing fire and water to open a gate or align weights and gears to trigger a sequence.
- **Combination puzzles**: Combine multiple mechanics (elemental arrows, device interactions, environmental elements) in a specific order to unlock a larger mechanism or sequence.

### Deliverable
Provide **10 level-specific puzzle concepts** (5 outside + 5 inside) that:
- Match the setting progression from early, simple puzzles outside the temple to more intricate, complex puzzles inside the temple.
- Introduce mechanics gradually (starting with basic interactions and elemental arrows, building up to advanced use of the Ancient Device and complex chain reactions).
- Blend the use of the bow’s elemental abilities, the Ancient Device’s interactions, and environmental puzzles to create interesting and challenging cause-and-effect sequences.
- Emphasize **fun chain reactions** and **critical sequencing** where players must plan their actions carefully.

### Additional Details:
- At the start of **Level 1**, the player meets the mysterious girl who explains the basics of the puzzles and hands over the **Ancient Device** and **Elemental Bow**. She provides guidance on how these tools can be used to solve puzzles, giving the player their first taste of the game's mechanics.
